* Notes
** Architecture
1. Take in Cifar-10 Dataset
2. Apply transformations images to batch 
3. Optionally apply Adversarial/gaussian preprocessing to batch
4. Select the optimizer
5. Do k times:
   1. Train for n epoch with the optimizer
   2. Compute the accuracy on Low Fourier-filtered images
   3. Compute the accuracy on High Fourier-filtered images
   4. Compute the accuracy on the same image (*without* fourier filter)
   5. Save the results (Json file?)
