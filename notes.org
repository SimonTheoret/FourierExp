* Notes
** Architecture
1. Take in Cifar-10 Dataset
2. Apply transformations to batch 
3. Optionally apply gaussian preprocessing to batch
4. Select the optimizer
5. Do k times:
   1. Train for 1 epoch with the optimizer
   2. Test the model:
      - If ADV training, compute the adv examples and train on it
      - Compute the accuracy on Low Fourier-filtered images on the test dataset
      - Compute the accuracy on High Fourier-filtered images on the test dataset
      - Compute the accuracy on the original images from the test dataset
   3. Save the results into a dict
6. Save the experiment results
