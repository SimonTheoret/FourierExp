* Notes
** Architecture
1. Take in Cifar-10 Dataset
2. Apply transformations to batch 
3. Optionally apply gaussian preprocessing to batch
4. Select the optimizer
5. Do k times:
   1. Train for 1 epoch with the optimizer
   2. Test the model:
      - If ADV training, compute the adv examples and train on it
      - Compute the accuracy on Low Fourier-filtered images on the test dataset
      - Compute the accuracy on High Fourier-filtered images on the test dataset
      - Compute the accuracy on the original images from the test dataset
   3. Save the results into a dict
6. Save the experiment results

* Reading
Readings from the original paper [[https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/b05b57f6add810d3b7490866d74c0053-Paper.pdf][Fourier perspective]].
1. Section 4.1
1. Section 4.2
2. Section 4.4
* Questions
- Why is the gaussian data augmentation not working ?
- What is the fourrier transform of Gaussian noise? Gaussian noise!
* Other experiments
** TODO Use different seeds and average
** TODO Computing the l_1 norm distribution of the Gaussian augmentations
The planning:
- Sample a few thousand vectors
- Compute the l_1 norm over these vectors
- Do a few graph, visualization
** TODO Computing accuracy with a few different bandwidth
The planning:
- For model /i/:
  - For bandwidth /B/:
    1. Compute the fourier transform of the dataset
    2. Apply low frequency pass
    3. Compute accuracy with low frequency passed images
    4. Apply high frequency pass
    5. Compute accuracy with high frequency passed images
  - Save the data:
    - Model
    - Optimizer used
    - High frequency accuracy
    - Low frequency accuracy
    - bandwidth

*** TODO Introduction
**** DONE Contexte
- [X] done
**** TODO Contenu
- [ ] Include results
**** TODO Conclusion
- [ ] Are the findings similar to original paper?
*** TODO Preliminaries
**** TODO Contexte
- [X] DONE
**** TODO Contenu
- [X] Specify what is shifting freq or not (high/low)
- [ ] if ADV: specify the attacks parameters
- [X] Specify the data augmentation used (random flip + crop)
**** TODO Conclusion
- [X] Settings are as similar as possible to the original paper
*** TODO Problem statement and related works
**** TODO Contexte
- [ ] Original paper had single architecture + optimizer
- [ ] What if their findings are related to arch or optim
**** TODO Contenu
- [X] Bunch of related works + citations
**** TODO Conclusion
- [ ] Finish with something like:
  "Here, we try to strenghten (or debunk) the findings from the
  fourier perspective "
*** TODO Experimental protocol
**** TODO Contexte
- [ ] Adversarial training is costly
- [ ] Computing the fourier transform of images is costly too
**** TODO Contenu
- [ ] If more experiments, add them here
- [ ] If removing experiments, modify this
- [ ] Quick word on limitations of the experiment
**** TODO Conclusion
- [ ] Small paragraph like this:
   "intuitively, this protocol allows us to check if ..."
