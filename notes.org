* Notes
** Architecture
1. Take in Cifar-10 Dataset
2. Apply transformations to batch 
3. Optionally apply gaussian preprocessing to batch
4. Select the optimizer
5. Do k times:
   1. Train for 1 epoch with the optimizer
   2. Test the model:
      - If ADV training, compute the adv examples and train on it
      - Compute the accuracy on Low Fourier-filtered images on the test dataset
      - Compute the accuracy on High Fourier-filtered images on the test dataset
      - Compute the accuracy on the original images from the test dataset
   3. Save the results into a dict
6. Save the experiment results

** TODO Computing the l_1 norm distribution of the Gaussian augmentations
The planning:
- Sample a few thousand vectors
- Compute the l_1 norm over these vectors
- Do a few graph, visualization
** TODO Computing accuracy with a few different bandwidth
The planning:
- For model /i/:
  - For bandwidth /B/:
    1. Compute the fourier transform of the dataset
    2. Apply low frequency pass
    3. Compute accuracy with low frequency passed images
    4. Apply high frequency pass
    5. Compute accuracy with high frequency passed images
  - Save the data:
    - Model
    - Optimizer used
    - High frequency accuracy
    - Low frequency accuracy
    - bandwidth
